                <li><h3>About Me</h3><hr></li>
                <p>I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo passionate about leveraging technology for social good.</p><br>
                <p>My interest in technology and development was sparked after attending my first hackathon, where I was first introduced to the wide applications of technology and programming.
                    Since then, I've strived to explore new technologies and programming languages. 
                    Although my experience and past projects have largely invovled front-end development and web design, I'm interested in branching out to back-end and app development as well. I'm currently expanding my skillset by creating a Discord bot using JavaScript.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I also have avid leadership experience, as outlined in my <a href=#experience>clubs and experience.</a>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I'm always open to new learning opportunities, and would love to connect! Please feel free to <a href=#contact>reach out.</a>

                <p id="thetext">The University of Waterloo Mathematics Society is the governing body representing all students in the faculty of math. As one of only two website developers, I was responsible for regular updates to our website, including updating pictures and links. Along with my fellow designer, I also redesigned our home page design, creating a wireframe using Figma and communicating with executive members of the council every step of the way. Implementing this design required some custom HTML and CSS code.</p>

                        <p>As someone who had only previously worked on programming projects with a group of people, the biggest takeaway I had from this project was how to solve my own bugs and use the Internet to answer my questions. I was able to brush up immensely on my HTML and CSS, and learned to create custom JavaScript functions. One aspect I found particularly challenging was implementing and linking the JavaScript needed for my sidebar for the “Clubs and Experiences” section. I’ve also had some challenges making my website more responsive to different screen sizes, and that is definitely the next step I’ll be taking to improve this project!</p>

We used Tensorflow and Pygame to create an app that tracked real-life user movements to play the game (resulting in the ultimate game to play while taking a break from schoolwork!), and I worked on obstacle generation and movement using Pygame.

                        <p>This project was my first introduction to game development, and opened my eyes to the applications of Python. I had never realized that the programming languages I had previously only used competitively could create video games. This project also gave me a glimpse of all the collaboration needed to put a project together. As each member of the group was working on a specific aspect or function, we had to link all the different aspects together, and could not test the project without having every aspect present. This presented some challenges while debugging, as there were so many functions working together that it was difficult to pinpoint where exactly we went wrong.

I had never envisioned that I could be the creator behind a chrome extension; something I had mindlessly used throughout my life. I was also introduced to the many steps needed before even starting to code: I browsed Behance for inspiration and used Figma to create a wireframe, all before even starting to code. On the more technical side, I learned a lot about using flexbox and creating grid layouts from this hackathon.</p>

                        <p>Notebooks Plus is a web application designed for desktops that allows for users to take time-stamped notes alongside recorded lectures or videos. Amidst the pandemic, we felt this app would help fellow students who came to rely on videos for online school. I created this project with a group of friends for Hack the North 2020 (a hackathon). The web app was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, although I worked exclusively on the front-end of the project. I was responsible for creating and implementing our design for the various pages of our app, including the home page, folder view, and notebook view.
